A challenge from Frontend Mentor - A responsive Single Price Grid Component

This is an exercise from Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/single-price-grid-component-5ce41129d0ff452fec5abbbc).

The goal was to build a Single price card looking as close as I could from the image and work thinking in a responsive way.

I also got to practice centering divs and elements using grid system. I also lernd how to use the pseudo-class :active to animate buttons.
